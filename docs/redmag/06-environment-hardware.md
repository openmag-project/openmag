## 3. Required Environment & Hardware

### Operating System
- **Windows is required**
  - MP Tools are Windows-only
  - Virtual machines are **not recommended** unless USB passthrough is proven stable

### Adapters
You will need an adapter to connect the SSD to your Windows machine:
- mSATA → USB
- microSATA → USB
- M.2 SATA → USB (ensure SATA, not NVMe)
- 2.5" SATA → USB

> USB adapters have proven reliable for MP Tool usage, but quality matters.
