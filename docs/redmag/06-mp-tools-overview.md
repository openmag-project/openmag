# MP Tools Overview

MP (Manufacturing Process) Tools are low-level utilities used by SSD vendors
to configure, test, and provision drives during manufacturing.

These tools allow modification of:
- Model name
- Capacity
- Firmware configuration

## Risks and realities

MP Tools are dangerous:
- Incorrect settings can permanently brick an SSD
- Tools are highly controller- and NAND-specific
- The same SSD model may require different tools over time

This project will maintain a list of known working SSD and MP Tool combinations,
but results are never guaranteed.
