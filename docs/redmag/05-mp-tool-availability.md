## MP Tool Availability Assessment

Once the controller and NAND are known:

- Confirm that an appropriate MP Tool exists **before purchasing**
- Typical research sources include:
  - USBDEV
  - Flashinfo
  - LCB
  - Archived vendor tools
  - Community research posts

Finding the correct MP Tool is often the **most time-consuming step**.

> ⚠️ Even when an MP Tool exists, it may:
> - Only support specific NAND revisions
> - Require undocumented configuration
> - Fail silently or brick the SSD
