# Recording Restrictions

When a RED camera detects an SSD that does not fully pass validation:

- The media may still be detected
- Formatting may succeed
- Recording time is artificially limited

This behavior is intentional and designed to restrict the use of
non-approved media.

Properly matching both the model name and capacity removes these limitations.
