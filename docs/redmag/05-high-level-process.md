# High-Level Process

At a high level, preparing a compatible REDMAG SSD involves:

1. Identifying a suitable SSD (controller and NAND)
2. Obtaining a compatible MP Tool
3. Modifying the SSD identity and capacity
4. Flashing the SSD
5. Validating behavior in-camera

This guide avoids step-by-step flashing instructions.
Instead, it focuses on understanding the process and associated risks.
