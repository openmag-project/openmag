## SSD Hardware Research (Pre-Purchase)

Before purchasing any SSD, you **must** research the following:

- **Controller model**
- **NAND type and manufacturer**
- **Form factor**
  - mSATA  
  - microSATA  
  - M.2 SATA (not NVMe)  
  - 2.5" Sata  

### Why This Matters

MP Tools are **controller- and NAND-specific**.  
Purchasing an SSD without confirming these details often results in:

- No compatible MP Tool
- Inability to enter production mode
- Permanent device failure

> **Recommendation:**  
> Prioritize SSDs using **Silicon Motion (SMI)** controllers, as leaked or publicly available MP Tools are more common for this ecosystem. This is still **not guaranteed**.
