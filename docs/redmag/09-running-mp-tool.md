## Running the MP Tool & Configuring the SSD

### Launching the MP Tool

1. Run the MP Tool executable
2. Expect antivirus warnings  
   - These tools access storage at a very low level
   - False positives are common

### Connecting the SSD

- Connect the SSD via USB adapter
- If the drive is not detected:
  - You **may** need to place the SSD into **ROM mode**
  - This typically involves shorting two test pads on the PCB
  - Not all SSDs require this

### Verifying Detection

- Click **Search** in the MP Tool
- The SSD must appear correctly in the device list
- If it does not, the MP Tool is likely incompatible
