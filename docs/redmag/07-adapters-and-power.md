# Adapters, Power, and External Testing

REDMAG validation only requires the **SATA data connection** to the camera.

External power can be supplied independently during testing.
This enables experimentation with:
- Custom adapters
- Alternate SSD form factors
- External SATA power solutions

## Supported protocols

- SATA: supported
- NVMe: not supported

Any custom solution must still present a valid SATA device to the camera.
