## Overview

This guide documents the general research workflow used to prepare compatible SSD media for RED cameras by matching controller, NAND, and firmware configuration parameters to known, camera-recognized REDMAG profiles.

The process involves:
- Researching SSD hardware components
- Identifying compatible MP (Mass Production) tools
- Modifying SSD metadata at a low level
- Verifying functionality in supported RED cameras

This is **not** a guaranteed or supported process, and success varies significantly by controller, NAND, firmware revision, and tooling.
