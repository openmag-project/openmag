# What is REDMAG?

REDMAG is RED Digital Cinema’s proprietary SSD-based recording media used in
RED ONE, EPIC, and SCARLET cameras.

While branded as proprietary media, REDMAG internally uses standard **SATA SSDs**
connected to the camera through a RED-designed PCB pass-through board.

That board adapts the SSD form factor and exposes a SATA interface to the camera.

Over the years, REDMAG units have been observed using:
- microSATA SSD modules
- mSATA SSD modules

Both types communicate using the SATA protocol.

NVMe-based SSDs are **not compatible** and will not work.
