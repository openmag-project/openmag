## Selecting the Correct MP Tool

Using the confirmed controller and NAND data:

- Locate the closest matching MP Tool version
- Exact matches are preferred
- Minor NAND mismatches may still fail

> ⚠️ Expect trial and error.  
> Even with correct hardware, multiple MP Tool versions may need testing.
