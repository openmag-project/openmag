# REDMAG Storage Hardware

## SATA protocol

REDMAG uses SATA. USB and NVMe are not supported.

## Form factors and voltages

### microSATA
- SATA
- 3.3V

### mSATA
- SATA
- 3.3V

### 2.5" SATA
- SATA
- 5V (external power required)

## NAND types

- SLC: rare, very durable
- MLC: preferred for sustained writes
- TLC: acceptable if high quality
- QLC: not recommended

## DRAM cache

SSDs with DRAM cache are strongly recommended for cinema workloads.
