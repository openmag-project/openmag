# REDMAG Storage Hardware

REDMAG media consists of three primary components:

1. The SSD itself (microSATA or mSATA)
2. A RED-designed PCB pass-through adapter
3. The camera’s SATA interface

## microSATA

microSATA SSDs were used in early REDMAG units but are no longer manufactured.
Modern replacements typically require adapters, which frequently cause camera
lockups or instability.

## mSATA

mSATA SSDs are significantly easier to work with:
- Widely available
- Better MP Tool support
- No fragile SATA adapters required

For these reasons, **mSATA is currently the recommended approach**.
