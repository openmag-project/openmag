The openMAG Project is an open-source, community-driven educational project focused on understanding cinema camera SSD media,
with an emphasis on REDMAG and MINIMAG, and documenting the concepts and validation workflows involved.

This repository is educational and research oriented. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by RED Digital Cinema.

## Why openMAG Project Exists

Many cinema cameras rely on approved, proprietary media. Over time, that media becomes harder to replace, more expensive,
or simply unavailable. When original SSD-based media starts to fail, creators can be left with fewer options:
pay escalating prices for aging stock, risk unreliable used media, or retire otherwise functional cameras.

The openMAG Project exists to preserve long-term usability of supported camera platforms by documenting how media works at a technical level,
and by sharing research that helps the community understand:

- how SSDs identify themselves and report capabilities
- how camera media validation commonly works (at a conceptual level)
- how to test, verify, and document outcomes safely and responsibly

This follows the spirit of other preservation-minded open projects that keep valuable hardware viable through time:
projects that reverse-engineer interfaces, publish compatibility knowledge, and build community-maintained documentation.
openMAG applies that same mindset to cinema SSD media—education first, evidence driven, and open to peer review.

## Who we are

The openMAG Project is built by a community of filmmakers, engineers, and hardware enthusiasts who care about:
- extending the useful life of professional tools
- reducing single-vendor dependency through knowledge and documentation
- sharing research openly so others can learn and contribute

If you have logs, photos, test results, controller/NAND identification, or documentation improvements, you can help.

## What this project is (and is not)

**This project is:**
- a learning resource and technical reference
- a documentation hub for SSD/media concepts and validation behavior
- a community space for collecting repeatable test results and troubleshooting

**This project is not:**
- a commercial product or service
- endorsed by, affiliated with, or supported by RED Digital Cinema
- a guarantee that any specific SSD will work in any specific camera
- a place to share proprietary binaries, leaked tools, or NDA-protected materials

## Safety and responsibility

Working with SSD firmware, low-level identifiers, adapters, and camera media can cause:
- permanent SSD failure (“bricking”)
- loss or corruption of footage
- camera instability
- voided warranties

You are responsible for your equipment, your data, and compliance with all applicable laws.
Read the disclosures in `legal/` before attempting experiments.

## Repository structure (high level)

- `docs/` — the educational content and guided learning paths  
- `legal/` — disclosures, trademarks, and liability limitations  
- `assets/` — images and diagrams (including the logo)

## Contributing

This project improves when the community contributes real-world findings and better explanations.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for:
- how to propose documentation edits
- how to submit test results (with enough detail to reproduce)
- what types of contributions are not accepted (for legal/safety reasons)

If you are new to contributing on GitHub, start small:
- fix wording or clarify a paragraph
- add a troubleshooting case and what resolved it
- add a reference link to a public datasheet or standard

## Legal and disclosures

Open-source documentation does not remove risk. The legal files exist to protect contributors and users,
and to keep the project grounded in educational intent.

- `legal/DISCLAIMER.md` — educational use and risk disclosure  
- `legal/LIABILITY.md` — limitation of liability  
- `legal/TRADEMARKS.md` — trademark attribution and non-affiliation statement  
- `legal/EDUCATIONAL_USE.md` — intent and scope of the project  

If you contribute, you agree to follow these guidelines and keep content educational and lawful.
